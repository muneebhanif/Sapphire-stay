  # --- State Management ---
  # Riverpod chosen over Provider for:
  #   1. Compile-time safety — providers are global & type-safe, eliminating runtime errors.
  #   2. Independent of widget tree — no BuildContext required to read state.
  #   3. Auto-dispose — automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks.
  #   4. Better testability — providers can be overridden per-test without widget scaffolding.
  #   5. Code generation support — reduces boilerplate at scale.
