Title: StaySite, A Web System for Sapphire Stay Hotel
Introduction:
Many hotels still manage reservations, room allocation, guest records, and billing using
manual methods. This often causes delays, errors, and difficulty in maintaining accurate
records. Without a proper web-based system, hotels also face limitations in providing
online information and booking services to customers.
Sapphire Stay Hotel currently does not have an integrated digital system for managing its
operations. The purpose of this project is to design and develop a hotel management web
system to automate basic hotel processes and provide an online interface for customers
and hotel staff, using Sapphire Stay Hotel as a case study.
Existing System/ Description of the Current Situation:
Sapphire Stay Hotel currently manages its operations manually. Reservations and
bookings are recorded on paper. Guest records, room allocation, and billing are
maintained manually at the reception desk. Reports on bookings and revenue
are generated using paper files, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
The hotel does not have a dedicated website or online booking system, limiting customer
access and reducing potential bookings. Manual operations make it difficult to track
payments, monitor room availability, and respond quickly to customer requests.
Problem Statement:
Sapphire Stay Hotel currently faces several operational challenges due to the lack of a
digital system. The hotel does not have a dedicated website or online booking system,
which limits customer access and convenience. Reservations, room allocation, guest
records, and billing are all handled manually, increasing the risk of errors and delays.
Generating reports on bookings, occupancy, and revenue is time-consuming, and tracking
payments or monitoring overall hotel operations is difficult. These limitations reduce
efficiency and make it harder to provide timely and accurate service to customers.
.Proposed Solution:
To address the current challenges, this project proposes the design and development of a
Hotel Management Web System for Sapphire Stay Hotel. The system will provide an
online interface for customers to view available rooms, check prices, and make
reservations. On the staff side, the system will automate room allocation, guest record
management, check-in/check-out processes, billing, and payment tracking. It will also
allow staff to generate reports on bookings and revenue easily.
By digitalizing these operations, the system aims to reduce errors, save time, improverecord accuracy, and enhance the overall efficiency of hotel management.
Scope of the Project:
Customer Module:
This module is designed for hotel guests to interact with the system online. Customers
can view detailed information about the hotel, including rooms, pricing, capacity, and
facilities. They can check room availability for specific dates, submit booking requests,
and receive booking confirmations. The module also includes a gallery of hotel and room
images, a services page, and a contact form with location map. Optional features include
submitting feedback and reviews. Overall, this module improves customer access,
convenience, and engagement with the hotel.
Staff Module:
The Staff Module provides limited access for daily hotel operations, suitable for receptionists
. Staff can handle bookings and walk-ins, perform guest check-in and check-out, and generate
invoices. They can track payments relevant to their operations but cannot access staff
management or system-wide reports. This module ensures smooth daily operations
while maintaining security and proper access control.
Admin Module:
The Admin Module provides full access to all hotel operations. Admins can manage
rooms, bookings, guest records, and the check-in/check-out process. They can generate
invoices, track payments, and monitor reports on bookings, occupancy, and revenue.
Admins also manage staff accounts and assign roles and permissions. This module
ensures centralized control and efficient management of the hotel.
